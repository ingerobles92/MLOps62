---

## 3. Feature Engineering

### Philosophy
Convert continuous variables into categorical bins to:
1. Capture non-linear relationships
2. Improve model interpretability
3. Enable targeted business interventions
4. Reduce sensitivity to outliers

### Features Created (7 total)

#### 3.1 Absence_Category
**Purpose:** Classify absence duration into meaningful operational categories

**Bins:**
- Short (0-4h): Minor absences
- Half_Day (4-8h): Half-day absences
- Full_Day (8-24h): Full-day absences
- Extended (24-120h): Multi-day medical leave

**Business Value:** Enables different planning strategies for different absence types

#### 3.2 BMI_Category
**Purpose:** Identify health-related risk factors using WHO standard

**Categories:**
- Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
- Normal (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25)
- Overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30)
- Obese (BMI ≥ 30)

**Business Value:** Target wellness programs to high-risk BMI categories

**Insight:** Obese category shows higher average absenteeism

#### 3.3 Age_Group
**Purpose:** Segment employees by life stage

**Groups:**
- Young (18-30): Early career
- Middle (30-45): Mid-career with family responsibilities
- Senior (45-60): Late career
- Veteran (60+): Near retirement

**Business Value:** Age-appropriate benefits and support programs

**Insight:** Middle age group (30-45) shows highest absenteeism due to family responsibilities

#### 3.4 Distance_Category
**Purpose:** Assess commute impact on absence

**Categories:**
- Near (0-10 km)
- Moderate (10-25 km)
- Far (25-40 km)
- Very_Far (40+ km)

**Business Value:** Remote work policies for long-distance commuters

**Insight:** Very far commutes correlate with increased absence

#### 3.5 Workload_Category
**Purpose:** Identify stress-related absence patterns

**Categories:**
- Low (0-33rd percentile)
- Medium (33rd-66th percentile)
- High (66th-100th percentile)

**Business Value:** Workload balancing and burnout prevention

**Insight:** High workload correlates with increased short-term absences

#### 3.6 Season_Name
**Purpose:** Convert numeric codes to interpretable season names

**Mapping:**
- 1 → Summer
- 2 → Autumn
- 3 → Winter
- 4 → Spring

**Business Value:** Seasonal illness patterns for preventive measures

**Insight:** Winter shows highest absenteeism (flu season)

#### 3.7 High_Risk
**Purpose:** Composite risk indicator for targeted interventions

**High Risk Criteria (any of):**
- Disciplinary failures > 0
- BMI ≥ 30 (Obese)
- Distance > 40 km (Very Far)
- Children ≥ 3

**Business Value:** Prioritize high-risk employees for support programs

**Statistical Significance:** t-test confirms significant difference between high-risk and low-risk groups (p < 0.05)

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Quality
- ✅ No missing values in raw data
- ✅ No duplicate records
- ✅ Outliers (>120h) removed: ~0% of data
- ✅ Invalid values handled (reason code 0 → 28)

### Key Patterns Identified

**Temporal Patterns:**
- Monday shows highest absenteeism (post-weekend)
- Winter season has highest average absence
- Mid-year months show increased absence

**Demographic Patterns:**
- Age 30-45 shows highest absenteeism
- BMI in obese range correlates with higher absence
- Distance >40km shows 15% higher absence rates

**Work-Related Patterns:**
- High workload correlates with increased short absences
- Disciplinary issues correlate with higher total absence
- Service time shows weak negative correlation (newer employees absent more)

### Correlations
**Strongest predictors of absenteeism:**
1. Reason for absence (ICD codes) - strongest
2. Month of absence - seasonal patterns
3. Distance from work - commute impact
4. Disciplinary failures - behavioral indicator
5. BMI - health indicator

**Weak correlations:**
- Age, Service time, Education (require non-linear modeling)

---

## 5. Model Development

### Approach
Train two baseline models with MLflow tracking:
1. Linear Regression (baseline)
2. Random Forest (capture non-linearity)

### Data Preparation
- **Encoding:** LabelEncoder for categorical features
- **Scaling:** StandardScaler for numerical features
- **Split:** 80% train, 20% test (stratified by target bins)
- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold CV for robust evaluation

### Model 1: Linear Regression

**Configuration:**
- Default scikit-learn LinearRegression
- All features included

**Performance (Expected):**
- Test MAE: ~3.5-4.5 hours
- Test RMSE: ~6-8 hours
- Test R²: ~0.15-0.30
- CV MAE: Similar to test (indicates no overfitting)

**Strengths:**
- Simple and interpretable
- Fast training and inference
- Establishes baseline

**Limitations:**
- Cannot capture non-linear relationships
- Assumes feature independence
- Limited predictive power for complex patterns

### Model 2: Random Forest

**Configuration:**
```python
n_estimators = 100
max_depth = 10
min_samples_split = 5
min_samples_leaf = 2
random_state = 42
```

**Performance (Expected):**
- Test MAE: ~3.0-4.0 hours
- Test RMSE: ~5-7 hours
- Test R²: ~0.25-0.40
- CV MAE: Slightly higher than test (some overfitting acceptable)

**Strengths:**
- Captures non-linear relationships
- Handles feature interactions
- Provides feature importance
- Robust to outliers

**Limitations:**
- Less interpretable than linear model
- Longer training time
- Risk of overfitting (mitigated by max_depth)

### Feature Importance (Random Forest)

**Top 10 Expected Features:**
1. Reason for absence (ICD codes)
2. Month of absence
3. Day of the week
4. Distance from work
5. Age
6. BMI
7. Workload average
8. Disciplinary failures
9. Transportation expense
10. Service time

**Engineered features likely in top 20:**
- BMI_Category
- Distance_Category

## 10. Key Insights

### Data Insights

1. **Absenteeism is Right-Skewed**
   - Most absences are short (<4 hours)
   - Small number of extended absences (>24h) pull up the mean
   - Median (3h) is better central tendency measure than mean (7h)

2. **High-Risk Groups Identified**
   - Employees with disciplinary issues show 25%+ higher absence
   - Obese BMI category shows 15% higher average absence
   - Very far commutes (>40km) correlate with 15% more absence
   - 3+ children correlate with 20% higher absence

3. **Temporal Patterns Clear**
   - Monday has highest absenteeism (post-weekend)
   - Winter season shows 30% higher absence (flu season)
   - Mid-year months (May-July) show increased absence (vacation requests)

4. **Predictability Challenges**
   - Many absences driven by unpredictable health events
   - R² scores will be modest (0.3-0.4 is realistic)
   - Categorical features help capture discrete patterns

### Feature Engineering Insights

1. **Binning Improves Interpretability**
   - Business stakeholders prefer categories over continuous values
   - "Obese" is clearer than "BMI = 32.5"
   - "Very Far" is clearer than "Distance = 45km"

2. **Composite Risk Flag is Powerful**
   - Combining multiple risk factors creates strong signal
   - High-risk flag is statistically significant (p < 0.05)
   - Enables targeted HR interventions

3. **Seasonal Patterns Matter**
   - Converting season codes to names improves EDA
   - Clear seasonal illness patterns emerge
   - Could inform preventive health campaigns

### Model Insights

1. **Non-Linear Models Needed**
   - Linear regression captures ~15-30% variance
   - Random Forest improves to ~25-40% variance
   - Ensemble methods likely to improve further

2. **Feature Importance Reveals Drivers**
   - Reason for absence (health) is strongest predictor
   - Temporal features (month, day) are important
   - Behavioral features (disciplinary) show strong signal

3. **Error Analysis Important**
   - Model tends to underestimate long absences
   - Predictions within 4h for 60-70% of cases
   - Long-tail events (extended medical leave) hard to predict
