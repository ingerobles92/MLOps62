    "## Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Quality is Critical\n",
    "Extreme outliers (4032 hours) destroyed model performance. Proper outlier detection and capping (120 hours) was essential for meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Pipeline Architecture Prevents Data Leakage\n",
    "- Feature transformers fit ONLY on training data\n",
    "- Same transformations applied to test data\n",
    "- Stateful transformers (e.g., WorkloadCategoryTransformer) learn percentiles from training set\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. SVR Outperformed Tree-Based Models\n",
    "Despite expectations, Support Vector Regression with RBF kernel achieved the best performance:\n",
    "- Better generalization than gradient boosting models\n",
    "- Lower variance in cross-validation scores\n",
    "- Simpler model with fewer hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Engineering Added Value\n",
    "The 6 engineered features (BMI category, age group, etc.) improved performance by:\n",
    "- Capturing non-linear relationships\n",
    "- Creating interpretable risk indicators\n",
    "- Reducing feature dimensionality through binning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Model Complexity vs. Performance\n",
    "Complex models (XGBoost aggressive) showed signs of overfitting:\n",
    "- Train MAE: 0.65 hours\n",
    "- Test MAE: 5.93 hours\n",
    "- Overfitting gap: -5.27 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler models (SVR, KNN) generalized better on this dataset."
